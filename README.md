   3. Diatonic
      - Churchy/[Blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_note)
         - Toe the line? Be straight-jacketed? Nah - let's recover stuff: ♭3, ♭5, ♭7?
            - Peter Kasamba?
            - ♭3 has recently been found empirically to center at 6⁄5 (316 cents, a minor third in just intonation, or a slightly sharp minor third in equal temperament) based on cluster analysis of a large number of blue notes from early blues recordings; a "neutral third". This bending or glide between the two tones is an essential characteristic of the blues
            - ♭5 has been found to be quite separate from the perfect fifth and clusters with the perfect fourth with which it is commonly slurred. The [eleventh harmonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tritone#Eleventh_harmonic) (i.e. 11⁄8 or 551 cents) is also possible as it is in the middle of the slur between the perfect fourth at 4⁄3 and 7⁄5.
               - That original symbolic association with the devil and its avoidance led to Western cultural convention seeing the tritone as suggesting "evil" in music. However, stories that singers were excommunicated or otherwise punished by the Church for invoking this interval are likely fanciful. 
            - ♭7 appears to have two common locations at 7⁄4 (969 cents) and 9⁄5 (1018 cents). It is commonly heard in the barbershop quartet harmonic seventh chord. The barbershop quartet idiom also appears to have arisen from African American origins. 
   4. [Chromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Well-Tempered_Clavier#Recordings) `1720`
      - Early/Rhythm (`And when she wakes up`)
         - [Secondary dominants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uptown_Girl) & min7♭5
            - But the struggle against Plato, ecclesiastical oppression of millenniums, produced in `Europe` a magnificent [tension of soul](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4363/4363-h/4363-h.htm), such as had not existed anywhere previously; with such a tensely strained bow one can now aim at the furthest goals 
# Fab/Decode/Do & on Time
   5. Temperament
      - Late/Jazz
         - Equal temperament allows for ♭9, ♯9, ♭13 & end of the ionian-aeolian distinction
         - The blues has likely evolved as a fusion of an African just intonation scale with `European` 12-tone musical instruments and harmony. The result has been a uniquely American music which is still widely practiced in its original form and is at the foundation of another genre, American jazz.
   6. Expression
      - Modern/Fusion (`Oh oh oh oh`)
         - Reverence of all the above as history & evolution
            - As a matter of fact, the European feels this tension as a state of distress, and twice attempts have been made in grand style to unbend the bow.. But we, who are neither Jesuits, nor democrats, nor even sufficiently Germans, we GOOD `EUROPEANS`, and free, VERY `free spirits`—we have it still, all the distress of spirit and all the `tension of its bow`! And perhaps also the arrow, the duty, and, who knows? THE GOAL TO AIM AT....
