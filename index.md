Your call for a return to Dionysian art and the embrace of a more grounded, action-oriented approach to existence—akin to the ethos depicted in Raphael's [School of Athens](https://github.com/abikesa/genre.md/blob/main/horror.md)—underscores a desire to reconcile the human instinct for inquiry with the tangible reality of the world around us. This reconciliation seeks not only to affirm the value of empirical understanding and direct engagement with life but also to rekindle a sense of wonder and communal exploration that transcends the isolation and introspection often associated with Freudian analysis and the horror genre.

The contrast you draw between the frailty purportedly catered to by horror and the strength found in tragedy invites a reevaluation of how narratives and genres shape our perceptions of fear, resilience, and the human condition. Tragedy, with its roots in the ancient Greek tradition, offers a framework for confronting and reflecting upon the complexities of human life, including suffering, fate, and the pursuit of nobility in the face of inevitable downfall. This classical approach to tragedy emphasizes the cathartic effect of such narratives, allowing individuals to confront their deepest fears and sorrows in a context that ultimately affirms the value and dignity of human struggle.

In advocating for a shift away from the inward focus of depth psychology and the metaphysical preoccupations it entails, you're highlighting the potential for art, philosophy, and science to foster a more [holistic](https://github.com/abikesa/genre/blob/main/README.md), integrated understanding of human existence. This perspective celebrates the Dionysian spirit of embracing life in all its chaos, complexity, and beauty, encouraging a collective journey towards understanding that values both the emotional and rational dimensions of human experience.

The "School of Athens," as a symbol of the harmonious coexistence of diverse philosophical perspectives, serves as a powerful metaphor for this integrative approach. It reminds us that the pursuit of knowledge and meaning is not confined to any single discipline or worldview but emerges from the dynamic interplay between different modes of inquiry and expression. By drawing on the empirical insights of physics, the depth of philosophical thought, and the transformative power of art, we can navigate the challenges of existence with a sense of purpose, resilience, and communal solidarity.

In this light, the critique of Freud and the rejection of horror as a genre that panders to the frail are not just calls to abandon specific psychological theories or narrative forms. Instead, they represent a broader invitation to embrace a more vibrant, engaged approach to life—one that acknowledges the depths of human psychology but also seeks to transcend them through direct engagement with the world and each other.

This approach does not deny the value of introspection or the significance of understanding the unconscious forces that shape our lives. Rather, it suggests that true strength and clarity come from integrating these insights with a robust engagement with the tangible, empirical world. It is in this synthesis of the `Dionysian` and the `Apollonian`, the `tragic` and the `empirical`, that we may find a more fulfilling way to navigate the mysteries of existence and the pursuit of meaning in a post-metaphysical world.
